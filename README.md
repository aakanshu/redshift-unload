# Redshift Extracts (UNLOAD with Headers)
This script is meant to simplify creating extracts from <a href="https://openbridge.com/warehouse/amazon-redshift" target="_blank">Redshift</a> by running a pre-packaged [`UNLOAD` command](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html). It also solves a big gap with the `UNLOAD` command: it will not output a header row. Not cool!

This script automatically retrieves and adds headers to the file before output, all from the convenience of a simple Docker container. A future update will also perform an audit to ensure the extracts match the runtime parameters.

## Requirements
Everything is built into the container, including [`psycopg2`](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html) and other OS and Python packages. You will need to have connection details to your Redshift host and the AWS credentials to write the `UNLOADED` data to an S3 bucket.

## Installing
To get the image, you need to have Docker installed. Once installed, you can get the image by pulling from [`Artifactory`](https://artifactory.gameofloans.com/)
```
docker pull docker.gameofloans.com/datascience/redshift-unload
```

### Setup Your Configuration File
With the Docker image pulled you need to create a configuration file. The script requires a configuration file named `config.json` in the same directory. The config file is comprised of the following parameters set here to obtain database connection info, AWS credentials and any `UNLOAD` options you prefer to use. However, you may also consider using Environment Variables.

#### Environment Variables

Since Docker works better with Environment variables, all 'db' options and the 'aws_\*' options can be set with environment variables:

- DB_HOST
- DB_PORT
- DB_DATABASE
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

#### Example Configuration File
A sample configuration file is below.

```json
{
    "db": {
        "host": "test.redshift.io",
        "port": "5439",
        "database": "db1",
        "user": "username",
        "password": "password"
    },
    "aws_access_key_id": "myawsaccesskeyid",
    "aws_secret_access_key": "myawssecretaccesskey",
    "unload_options": [
    	"ADDQUOTES",
    	"PARALLEL OFF",
    	"ALLOWOVERWRITE",
    	"GZIP",
    	"DELIMITER ','"
    ]
}
```

## Running An Extract
This command will unload the data in the table ``mytable`` using ``datecol`` for the period to a specified S3 location.

One important note is that you need to pass the configuration file into the container. This is done via the volume `-v` command. You basically put your local path to the file `/local/path/to/my/config.json` and then map it to the root of the container like this `/config.json`. It should look something like this `-v /local/path/to/my/config.json:/config.json`.

Running it via Docker command:
```python
docker run -it -v /local/path/to/my/config.json:/config.json docker.gameofloans.com/datascience/redshift-unload -t mytable -f s3://dest-bucket/foo/bar/output_file.csv -r datecol -r1 2017-01-01 -r2 2017-06-01
```

You can also EXEC into the container which allows you to run it as well.
```python
python unload.py -t mytable -f s3://dest-bucket/foo/bar/output_file.csv -r datecol -r1 2017-01-01 -r2 2017-06-01
```

## Runtime Parameters
The script can accept different runtime parameters:
* ``-t``: The table you wish to UNLOAD
* ``-f``: The S3 key at which the file will be placed
* ``-c``: (Optional) The schema which the table resides in. If left blank, the script will default to "public".
* ``-s`` (Optional): The file you wish to read a custom valid SQL WHERE clause from. This will be sanitized then inserted into the UNLOAD command.
* ``-r`` (Optional): The range column you wish to use to constrain the results. Any type supported by Redshift's [BETWEEN function](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_range_condition.html) is accepted here (date, integer, etc.)
* ``-r1`` (Optional): The desired start range to constrain the result set
* ``-r2`` (Optional): The desired end range to constrain the result set  
Note:  ``-s`` and ``-d`` are mutually exlusive and cannot be used together. If neither is used, the script will default to not specifying a WHERE clause and output the entire table.

### The `-s` Option
As mentioned previously, it is possible to supply your own WHERE clause to be used in the UNLOAD command. This is done via an external SQL file.

Here is an example. To use this functionality to UNLOAD only new users, you create a SQL file called `new-users.sql` that contains ``WHERE is_new = true``. Pretty simple.

```python
python unload.py -t mytable -f s3://dest-bucket/foo/bar/output_file.csv -r datecol -r1 2017-01-01 -r2 2017-06-01 -s /new-users.sql
```

**NOTE**: The -s option will **only** work for the `WHERE` clause. If you try other clauses it will fail. The script would need to be enhanced to do more.


## Security
It may be wise to create a read-only user on the database for the script to use. This will improve the security of the script by further protecting against SQL injection. For more information on how to do this, check the manual for your database type.
